w write mode - if the file does not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, it will be overwritten.
r read mode - if the file does not exist, it will raise an error. If it exists, it will be opened for reading.
a append mode - if the file does not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, new data will be added to the end of the file without overwriting the existing content.
